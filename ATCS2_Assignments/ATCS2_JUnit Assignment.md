# JUnit

JUnit is a framework for writing tests for Java classes. While you will be working in more than just Java this year, JUnit testing is a great framework to know. Similarly, learning it will be a good return to coding for you to start the year and help you think about the testing process.

## To Do
1. Check out: [http://www.tutorialspoint.com/junit/][1] or any other JUnit resources you can find.
2. Get JUnit installed and running.
3. Create a demonstration program for JUnit. You may recycle old code for the demo, but make sure it is simple enough that is does not make it difficult to understand JUnit's functionality. Make sure you comment your code.
4. Create a folder called JUnit\_Test in your ATCS repository. In there put any necessary .java files to run your program. Also, include a readMe text file that explains how to run your demo and what it does (i.e., what itâ€™s testing).
