# Researching and building a more complex Data Structure

For this assignment, you will research and build a data structure of greater complexity than those you worked with in ATCS1. 

## What to do

Step 1 is doing some research on data structures. A good starting point would be to read more about data structures you already know - in particular graphs and trees - and read about variants. You may also consider searching through the syllabus for college level data structure courses and see if you can find an interesting lab assignment. 

Once you’ve settled on a structure, you will need to decide upon an implementation for it. Unlike previous assignments where I assign you an API, you should design your own API based on how you want your data structure to behave. You should provide that API in your repository for this project.

You will also need to decide upon a project for demonstrating your data structure. Is there a problem that your data structure is particularly adept at solving? Again, do not feel the need to reinvent the wheel. You may borrow assignment ideas from other sources (though be certain to cite all materials). Once you’ve settled on a project, you may need to tweak you API accordingly.

Now you can code! I would start by coding a test file for your data structure (preferably using JUnit). Once you have that, you can code the data structure itself and the accompanying project. 

## Questions to consider

1. What data structures and projects did you consider?
2. Why is this data structure useful? 
3. What implementation decisions did you make and what challenges did you encounter?

### Just a few possible ideas
- Randomized Queues and Deques: [https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall15/cos226/assignments/queues.html][1]
- Markov Model of Natural Language: [http://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/spring16/cos126/assignments/markov.html][2]
- Kd-Trees: [https://www.cs.princeton.edu/courses/archive/fall15/cos226/assignments/kdtree.html][3]
- More Kd-Trees: [http://cs.brown.edu/courses/cs032/projects/stars/][4]

## Deliverables
In your repository, please commit:
1. A README file, explaining your project (what it is, how to run it) and reflecting about the questions to consider.
2. An API for your data structure.
3. A test class for your data structure.
4. All files necessary to run your project.

### MAKE SURE YOU COMMIT EVERY CLASS
