Below is a general outline that you can use in producing your project research document. Feel free to use these headers as a way of organizing your information. However, do NOT simply go through and answer every question. These are guiding questions to help you write. You should only address them as appropriate based on your specific project. You may also have more relevant information to share.

Keep in mind that your audience is, as with general commenting, someone who has a general background in computer science, but no specific knowledge of what you are doing.
