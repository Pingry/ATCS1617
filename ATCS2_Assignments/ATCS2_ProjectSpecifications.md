# Advanced Topics in Computer Science
# Project Outline

## Topics list: 
- Machine Learning
- Artificial Intelligence
- Physical Computing
- Web Development
- Philosophy of Computer Science

## Steps:
1. First, you will need to build at least a little familiarity with these topics. You may notice that the topics are not necessarily equivalent. Something like web development can be broadly defined as a topic, but also as a skill or tool. In fact, you may end up using a web app to do a project related to one of the other four topics. 
2. Find a case study that heavily involves one of the topics above. Get approval from me.
3. Deconstruct the case study and present it to the group for discussion. (Guidelines to be provided.)
4. Brainstorm a list of A) projects you could do to replicate (and consequently learn) important work done in your chosen field; and B) problems, both big and small, that your chosen field could address.
5. Meet with me and/or the class to discuss your list. Determine what items in both lists you will attempt and an outline for when you will do each piece. Be specific. Get approval from me for your outline. (BB to provide spreadsheet for dates)
6. Code your project.
7. Present on your project and submit your project writeup and code.
8. Repeat as necessary.

### Example Case Studies
- The Netflix Problem
- Self-driving cars (you probably would want to narrow in on something specific within this field).
- The “Vacuum World” problem from Artificial Intelligence: A Modern Approach. (For reference: [http://web.ntnu.edu.tw/\~tcchiang/ai/Vacuum%20Cleaner%20World.htm][4])
- Almost any project that has been successfully built on a Raspberry Pi or an Arduino board. 
- Deep Blue
### Deeper Dives
