### What will be evaluated
When evaluating your projects, I will run all runner and test files and read your read me file. I will also look through your code for style issues. Lastly, I will look at your commit timeline and consider your class and online (Slack) participation. I will __not__ edit your code in an effort to fix mistakes. I will also not write extra tests for you.
