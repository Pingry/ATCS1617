It is expected that you will collaborate with your peers in this course. Similarly, it is expected that you will be able to use the Internet to do research how to get things done. However, _How_ you do both of these things is important! 

*Collaborating with Peers*
1. All online collaboration should be done through Slack (advancedtopicsincs.slack.com). Do not discuss assignments via e-mail, text, snapchat, facebook, wechat, instagram, etc. If you’re communicating about classwork and that communication is being converted to 1’s and 0’s by a machine, put it on Slack.
2. Use __public__slack channels for communication.
3. In both in-person and digital discussions, do not talk directly about code. A good rule of thumb is that if you have to say more than “I think you forgot a semi-colon there,” then you’re probably saying too much. You may freely discuss assignment expectations, algorithms, resources, and design. You may not tell someone what code she or he should write. 

	Good comment: “Have you thought about just using nested conditionals?”
	Bad comment: “Just put if(!someConditional) 

4. When in doubt, ask yourself: “Am I learning anything or am I helping my classmate learn?”
5. These same rules apply for interactions between ATCS1 and ATCS2 students.

*Online Research*

1. Google is your friend. As is Stack Overflow, APIs, tutorials, etc, etc. Use them. 
2. That said, you may __not__Google or otherwise search for specific solutions. 

	Good search: What does a copy constructor do?
	Bad search: Java implementation of Traveling Salesman problem

3. You should always cite where you got your information from. You can do this in a block comment above the code that reflects your research. This will help you in the event that you infringe upon rule #2.
